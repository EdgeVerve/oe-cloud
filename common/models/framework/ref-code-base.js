* @classdesc This class is base class for various reference code models.
* Reference code is typically of form "type, code, description".
* Here, for each type, a new reference code model will be added,
* which will have code and description as fields inherited from RefCodeBase
* One can use "refcodetype" property in a model which automatically renders the field as combo
* and does validation automatically for this property against the list of codes.
